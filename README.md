# Data Structure Project

1. Implements a Hashtable to store all students data.
2. Implements a binary search tree to store all students data.
3. Allow users to search for certain data efficiently using hash table.
4. Rehash the current hash table to a bigger hash table: 2*current_table_size + 1 
when the amount of data passes a certain threshold.
5. Allow users to sort data efficiently using binary search tree.
6. Implements a recycle bin that allow users to retrieve deleted data.
